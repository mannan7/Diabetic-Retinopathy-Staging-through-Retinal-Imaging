This project is part of my graduate course CAP 6545: Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data. It involves the implementation of a model architecture based on the work of Kumari, P., Saxena, P. in their study [Disease localization and its prediction from retinal fundus images using explicitly designed deep learning architecture](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-023-16585-2) published in Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023).

Unlike the original study, this project employs a unique preprocessing approach developed through my own research and trial-and-error experiments.

Instructions for Running the Code:
1. Log in to Google Colab and upload the .ipynb file.
2. Obtain your kaggle.json API token from your Kaggle account (required for dataset access).
3. Run the code on your choice of hardware accelerator in Google Colab (e.g., a GPU or TPU).
